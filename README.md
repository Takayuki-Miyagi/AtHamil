# AtHamil
This code generates the matrix elements of atomic Hamiltonian with the Hamonic-Oscillator, Hydrogen, Laguerre-function basis sets.
For the details of Laguerre-function basis, see A. E. McCoy and M. A. Caprio, J. Math. Phys. 57, (2016).

Currently, it can generate only non-relativistic Coulomb Hamiltonian.

Python code is only for the quick test.
